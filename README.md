# signal-lights
The Signal Lights Control project helps manage the order and timing of traffic-style signal lights (A, B, C, D). Users can set the sequence and how long each light stays green or yellow. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the interface), and PHP (for the backend). You need XAMPP to run the PHP parts.
